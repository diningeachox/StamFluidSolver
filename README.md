# C++ Implementation of Jos Stam's [Stable Fluid Solver](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/15-464/Fall09/papers/StamFluidforGames.pdf)

Jos Stam's seminal 1999 paper in fluid simulation provided a stable (meaning that the flows don't blow up) way to simulate the Navier-Stokes equations of a fluid.
This implementation was written in C++ and rendered using OpenGL.

## Usage
- Right-mouse: drop coloured dye into the fluid
- Left-mouse: move the fluid around
- Q: switch to **red** dye
- W: switch to **green** dye
- E: switch to **blue** dye

## Packages required 
- OpenGL (glew, glfw)
